## Description

Disable cross-tenant replication to prevent data from being replicated to storage accounts in other Azure tenants, reducing data exfiltration risks.

Cross-tenant replication in Azure allows data to be replicated across multiple Azure tenants. While this may be useful in some scenarios, it can pose a security risk by allowing data to be copied to storage accounts outside of your organization's control. Disabling this feature helps prevent potential data exfiltration.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Storage Accounts`.
2. For each storage account, under `Data management`, click `Object replication`.
3. Under `Cross-tenant replication`, select `Disabled`.
4. Click `Save`.

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-cross-tenant-replication false
```

### From PowerShell

```bash
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <storage-account> -AllowCrossTenantReplication $false
```

### Default Value

Cross-tenant replication may be enabled by default on some storage accounts.
