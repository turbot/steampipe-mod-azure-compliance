## Description

Disable anonymous blob access to prevent unauthorized public access to blob data in storage accounts.

Anonymous public read access to containers and blobs in Azure Blob storage is a convenient way to share data but might present a security risk. It's important to keep in mind the security risk posed by allowing anonymous access and to understand the settings available to configure anonymous access. By disabling anonymous access at the storage account level, you prevent all containers in that storage account from being configured for anonymous access.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Storage Accounts`.
2. For each storage account, under `Settings`, click `Configuration`.
3. Under `Allow Blob anonymous access`, select `Disabled`.
4. Click `Save`.

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access false
```

### From PowerShell

```bash
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <storage-account> -AllowBlobPublicAccess $false
```

### Default Value

Anonymous blob public access may be enabled by default.
