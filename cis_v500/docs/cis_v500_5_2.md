## Overview

This subsection contains recommendations for Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra ID.

Conditional Access is Microsoft Entra ID's policy engine that evaluates signals from user identity, location, device, and application to make access decisions. It enables organizations to implement intelligent access control based on various conditions.

### Controls

- **5.2.1**: Define trusted locations
- **5.2.2**: Geographic access policies
- **5.2.3**: Device code flow policies
- **5.2.4**: MFA policy for all users
- **5.2.5**: MFA for risky sign-ins
- **5.2.6**: MFA for Azure Service Management API
- **5.2.7**: MFA for Microsoft Admin Portals
- **5.2.8**: Token protection policies

### Conditional Access Capabilities

Conditional Access enables:
- Location-based access control (trusted/untrusted locations)
- Risk-based access decisions (sign-in risk, user risk)
- Device compliance requirements
- Application-specific policies
- Token protection and binding
- Session controls and limitations

### Requirements

- Requires Microsoft Entra ID Premium P1 or P2 license
- Should be tested in report-only mode before enforcement
- Requires emergency access (break-glass) accounts excluded from all policies
