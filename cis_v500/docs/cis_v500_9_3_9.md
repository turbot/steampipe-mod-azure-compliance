## Description

Apply delete locks to critical storage accounts to prevent accidental or malicious deletion.

Resource Manager locks allow organizations to put a restriction on operations for a resource, resource group, or subscription. Delete locks prevent deletion of resources, ensuring that critical data and storage accounts are protected from accidental or intentional removal.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Storage Accounts`.
2. For each critical storage account, under `Settings`, click `Locks`.
3. Click `+ Add`.
4. Provide a `Lock name`.
5. For `Lock type`, select `Delete`.
6. Optionally, add notes explaining the purpose of the lock.
7. Click `OK`.

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az lock create --name <lock-name> --lock-type CanNotDelete --resource-group <resource-group> --resource-name <storage-account> --resource-type Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
```

### From PowerShell

```bash
New-AzResourceLock -LockName <lock-name> -LockLevel CanNotDelete -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -ResourceName <storage-account> -ResourceType Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
```

### Default Value

No locks are applied by default.
