## Description

Restricts group creation to administrators with permissions only.

Self-service group management enables users to create and manage security groups or Office 365 groups in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Unless a business requires this day-to-day delegation for some users, self-service group management should be disabled.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

  1. From Azure Home select the Portal Menu
  2. Select `Azure Active Directory`
  3. Then `Groups`
  4. Select `General` in setting
  5. Ensure that `Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access Pane` is set to `Yes`

Please **note** that at this point of time, there is no Azure CLI or other API commands available to programmatically conduct security configuration for this recommendation

### Default Value

By default, `Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access Pane` is set to `No`
