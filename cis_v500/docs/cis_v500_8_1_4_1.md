## Description

Microsoft Defender for Containers helps improve, monitor, and maintain the security of containerized assets—including Kubernetes clusters, nodes, workloads, container registries, and images—across multi-cloud and on-premises environments.

Defender for Containers provides:
- Vulnerability assessment for container images
- Runtime threat detection for Kubernetes clusters
- Kubernetes configuration assessment
- Control plane hardening
- Network segmentation recommendations

Enabling this plan protects against container-specific threats and vulnerabilities throughout the container lifecycle.
