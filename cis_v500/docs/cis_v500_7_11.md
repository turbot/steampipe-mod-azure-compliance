## Description

Protect subnet resources by ensuring subnets are associated with network security groups, which can filter inbound and outbound traffic using security rules.

Unprotected subnets can expose resources to unauthorized access.

## Remediation

**Remediate from Azure Portal**

1. Go to `Virtual networks.`
2. Click the name of a virtual network.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Subnets`.
4. Click the name of a subnet.
5. Under `Security`, next to `Network security group`, click None to display the drop-down menu.
6. Select a network security group.
7. Click `Save`.
8. Repeat steps 1-7 for each virtual network and subnet requiring remediation.

**Remediate from Azure CLI**

For each subnet requiring remediation, run the following command to associate it with a network security group:

```bash
az network vnet subnet update --resource-group <resource-group> --vnet-name <virtual-network> --name <subnet> --network-security-group <network-securitygroup>
```

## Default Value

By default, a subnet is not associated with a network security group.
