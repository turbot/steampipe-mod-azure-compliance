## Overview

**IMPORTANT:** The Azure "Security Defaults" recommendations represent an entry-level set of recommendations which will be relevant to organizations and tenants that are either just starting to use Azure or are only utilizing a bare minimum feature set such as the freely licensed tier of Microsoft Entra ID. Security Defaults recommendations are intended to ensure that these entry-level use cases are still capable of establishing a strong baseline of secure configuration.

**If your subscription is licensed to use Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2, it is strongly recommended that the "Security Defaults" section (this section and the recommendations therein) be bypassed in favor of the use of "Conditional Access."**
