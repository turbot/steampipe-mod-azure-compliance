## Description

Container soft delete protects your data from being accidentally deleted by maintaining the deleted data in the system for a specified period of time. During the retention period, you can restore a soft-deleted container and its contents to the container's state at the time it was deleted.

Enabling soft delete for containers provides an additional layer of protection against accidental or malicious deletion of entire blob containers.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Storage Accounts`.
2. For each storage account, under `Data management`, click `Data protection`.
3. Under `Recovery`, locate `Enable soft delete for containers`.
4. Check the box to enable soft delete for containers.
5. Set the retention period in days (recommended minimum: 7 days).
6. Click `Save`.

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az storage account blob-service-properties update --account-name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --enable-container-delete-retention true --container-delete-retention-days <retention-days>
```

### From PowerShell

```bash
Enable-AzStorageContainerDeleteRetentionPolicy -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -StorageAccountName <storage-account> -RetentionDays <retention-days>
```

### Default Value

Soft delete for containers may be enabled by default with a 7-day retention period, but this should be verified and configured according to organizational requirements.
