## Description

Configure geo-redundant storage (GRS) for critical storage accounts to ensure data availability and disaster recovery capabilities.

Geo-redundant storage (GRS) replicates your data to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region. If your storage account has GRS enabled, your data is durable even in the case of a complete regional outage or a disaster in which the primary region isn't recoverable. This provides additional data protection and business continuity for critical storage accounts.

GRS provides multiple replication options:
- **GRS (Geo-redundant storage)**: Asynchronously replicates data to a secondary region
- **RA-GRS (Read-access geo-redundant storage)**: Same as GRS but with read access to the secondary region
- **GZRS (Geo-zone-redundant storage)**: Combines zone-redundant storage with geo-redundant storage
- **RA-GZRS (Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage)**: Same as GZRS but with read access to the secondary region

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Storage Accounts`.
2. For each critical storage account, under `Data management`, click `Redundancy`.
3. Under `Redundancy`, select one of the following:
   - `Geo-redundant storage (GRS)`
   - `Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)`
   - `Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)`
   - `Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)`
4. Click `Save`.

**Note:** Changing the redundancy option may incur additional costs and take time to complete.

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --sku Standard_GRS
```

Or for read-access:

```bash
az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --sku Standard_RAGRS
```

### From PowerShell

```bash
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <storage-account> -SkuName Standard_GRS
```

Or for read-access:

```bash
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <storage-account> -SkuName Standard_RAGRS
```

### Default Value

The default redundancy option varies but is typically Locally Redundant Storage (LRS), which does not provide geo-redundancy.
