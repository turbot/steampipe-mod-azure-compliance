## Description

The TLS(Transport Layer Security) protocol secures transmission of data over the internet using standard encryption technology. Encryption should be set with the latest version of TLS. App service allows *TLS 1.2* by default, which is the recommended TLS level by industry standards, such as PCI DSS.

It is highly recommended to use the latest *TLS 1.2* version for web app secure connections. App service currently allows the web app to set TLS versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.

As default, TLS Version feature will be set to 1.2.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Login to Azure Portal and go to `App Services`.
2. Click on each App.
3. Under `Settings` section, click on `TLS/SSL settings`.
4. Under `Protocol Settings`, set `Minimum TLS Version` to `1.2`.

### From Command Line

To set TLS Version for an existing app, run the following command:

```bash
az webapp config set --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <APP_NAME> --min-tls-version 1.2
```
