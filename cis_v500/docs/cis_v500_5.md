## Overview

This section contains recommendations for Identity Services in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).

Identity is the foundation of security in Azure. Properly configured identity services ensure that only authorized users can access resources and that access is appropriately managed and monitored.

### Subsections

- **5.1:** Security Defaults (Per-User MFA)
- **5.2:** Conditional Access
- **5.3:** Periodic Identity Reviews

### Additional Controls

This section also includes standalone controls (5.4 - 5.28) covering:
- Tenant and user management settings
- Password policies and authentication requirements
- Application registration and consent
- Guest user access controls
- Group creation and management
- Device registration security
- Role-based access control
- Subscription ownership

### Key Security Areas

- **Mult-Factor Authentication**: Ensure MFA is enabled and required for all users and privileged operations
- **Conditional Access**: Implement policies for location-based, risk-based, and application-based access control
- **Identity Governance**: Regular review of user access, role assignments, and permissions
- **Password Security**: Enforce strong password policies and enable password protection features
- **Application Security**: Control application registration and user consent
- **Guest Access**: Manage and restrict external user access
- **Administrative Privileges**: Limit and monitor privileged role assignments
- **Passwordless Authentication**: Consider modern authentication methods
