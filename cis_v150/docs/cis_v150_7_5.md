## Description

Install endpoint protection for all virtual machines.

Installing endpoint protection systems (like anti-malware for Azure) provides for realtime protection capability that helps identify and remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. These also offer configurable alerts when known-malicious or unwanted software attempts to install itself or run on Azure systems.

## Remediation

Follow Microsoft Azure documentation to install endpoint protection from the security center. Alternatively, you can employ your own endpoint protection tool for your OS.

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Security Center`
2. Click the `Recommendations` blade
3. Ensure that there are no recommendations for `Endpoint Protection not installed on Azure VMs`

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az vm show -g MyResourceGroup -n MyVm -d
```

It should list below or any other endpoint extensions as one of the installed extensions.

```bash
EndpointSecurity || TrendMicroDSA* || Antimalware || EndpointProtection ||
SCWPAgent || PortalProtectExtension* || FileSecurity*
```

Alternatively, you can employ your own endpoint protection tool for your OS.

###  Default Value

By default Endpoint Protection is disabled.
