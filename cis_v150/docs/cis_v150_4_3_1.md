## Description

`SSL connectivity` helps to provide a new layer of security by connecting database server to client applications using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Enforcing SSL connections between database server and client applications helps protect against "man in the middle" attacks by encrypting the data stream between the server and application.

## Remediation

### From Azure Console

  1. Login to Azure Portal using https://portal.azure.com
  2. Go to Azure Database for `PostgreSQL server`
  3. For each database, click on `Connection security`
  4. In `SSL` settings, click on `ENABLED` to enforce SSL connections
  5. Click `Save`

### From Azure CLI

Use the below command to `enforce ssl connection` for `PostgreSQL` Database

```bash
az postgres server update --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --name
<serverName> --ssl-enforcement Enabled
```

### Default Value:

By default, secure connectivity is enforced, but some application frameworks may not enable it during deployment.
