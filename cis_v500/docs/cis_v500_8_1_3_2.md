## Description

Enable vulnerability assessment for machines on both Azure and hybrid (Arc-enabled) machines to identify security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

Vulnerability assessment for machines provides:
- Operating system and software vulnerability scanning
- Security configuration assessment
- Missing security update identification
- Integration with Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management or Qualys

This component helps identify and remediate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.
