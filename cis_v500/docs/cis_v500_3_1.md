## Overview

This section contains recommendations for Virtual Machine security configurations in Azure.

Virtual Machines are a core compute service in Azure and require proper security controls to protect against unauthorized access and ensure compliance with security policies.

### Key Security Areas

- **Identity and Access Management**: Control who can access virtual machines
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Ensure MFA is required for privileged access
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement least privilege principles
- **Security Monitoring**: Track and audit VM access and activities
