## Overview

Azure Storage Accounts provide a unique namespace in Azure for your data. This section covers comprehensive security controls for storage accounts including:

- **Secrets and Keys Management** - Key rotation reminders, periodic regeneration, and disabling shared key access
- **Networking** - Private endpoints, public network access controls, and default network rules
- **Identity and Access Management** - Microsoft Entra ID authorization
- **Encryption and Transfer Security** - Secure transfer requirements and minimum TLS versions
- **Data Protection** - Cross-tenant replication restrictions, anonymous access controls
- **Operational Security** - Resource locks and geo-redundancy configurations

Implementing these controls helps ensure that storage accounts are secured against unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and accidental deletion while maintaining high availability.
