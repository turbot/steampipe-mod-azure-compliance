## Overview

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Do not use the recommendations in this section for audit or remediation.

For the services that these recommendations are relevant to, a copy of the reference recommendation with full and accurate audit and remediation procedures will be found in the section dedicated to that service.

This section is intended to provide a generic reference for common recommendation types that are applicable to multiple Products and Services within the CSP environment. Common Reference Recommendations are those that recommend the use of different types of networking or connection methodologies, data or secret protection, or are otherwise generally used throughout the CSP environment and might result in additional duplicate recommendations. These recommendations will be copied to the named Service sections to which they apply and be augmented with audit and remediation procedures that are accurate to the specific Service.
