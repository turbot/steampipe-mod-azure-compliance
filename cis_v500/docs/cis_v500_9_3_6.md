## Description

In some cases, Azure Storage sets the minimum TLS version to be version 1.0 by default. TLS 1.0 is a legacy version and has known vulnerabilities. This minimum TLS version can be configured to be later protocols such as TLS 1.2.

## Remediation

### Remediate from Azure Portal

1. Go to `Storage Accounts.`
2. For each storage account, under `Settings`, click `Configuration`.
3. Set the `Minimum TLS version` to `Version 1.2.`
4. Click `Save`.

### Remediate from Azure CLI

```bash
az storage account update \
 --name <storage-account> \
 --resource-group <resource-group> \
 --min-tls-version TLS1_2
```

### Remediate from PowerShell

To set the minimum TLS version, run the following command:

```bash
Set-AzStorageAccount -AccountName <STORAGEACCOUNTNAME> ` -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCEGROUPNAME> ` -MinimumTlsVersion TLS1_2
```

### Default Value

If a storage account is created through the portal, the MinimumTlsVersion property for that storage account will be set to TLS 1.2.

If a storage account is created through PowerShell or CLI, the MinimumTlsVersion property for that storage account will not be set, and defaults to TLS 1.0.
