## Description

Ensure that the number of days before users are asked to re-confirm their authentication information is not set to 0.

This setting is necessary if you have setup 'Require users to register when signing in option'. If authentication re-confirmation is disabled, registered users will never be prompted to re-confirm their existing authentication information. If the authentication information for a user changes, such as a phone number or email, then the password reset information for that user reverts to the previously registered authentication information.
