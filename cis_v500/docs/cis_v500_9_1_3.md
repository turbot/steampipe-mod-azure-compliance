## Description

Implement SMB channel encryption with AES-256-GCM for SMB file shares to ensure data confidentiality and integrity in transit.

SMB channel encryption protects data in transit between the client and the file share. AES-256-GCM provides strong encryption with authenticated encryption, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity of the data during transmission.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Storage Accounts`.
2. For each storage account with file shares, under `Settings`, click `Configuration`.
3. Under `File share settings`, locate `SMB`.
4. Under `SMB channel encryption`, select `AES-256-GCM` or higher.
5. Click `Save`.

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --smb-encryption-type AES-256-GCM
```

### From PowerShell

```bash
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <storage-account> -SmbEncryptionType AES-256-GCM
```

### Default Value

The default encryption type may vary. It is recommended to explicitly configure AES-256-GCM encryption.
