## Description

Disable access from Azure services to PostgreSQL Database Server

If access from Azure services is enabled, the server's firewall will accept connections from all Azure resources, including resources not in your subscription. This is usually not a desired configuration. Instead, set up firewall rules to allow access from specific network ranges or VNET rules to allow access from specific virtual networks.

## Remediation

### From Azure Console

  1. Login to Azure Portal using https://portal.azure.com
  2. Go to `Azure Database` for `PostgreSQL server`
  3. For each database, click on `Connection security`
  4. In `Firewall rules`
  5. Ensure Allow access to Azure services is set to `OFF`.
  6. Click `Save` to apply the changed rule.

### From Azure CLI

Use the below command to delete the AllowAllAzureIps rule for PostgreSQL Database.

```bash
az postgres server firewall-rule delete --name AllowAllAzureIps --resourcegroup <resourceGroupName> --server-name <serverName>
```

### Default Value:

The Azure Postgres firewall is set to block all access by default.
