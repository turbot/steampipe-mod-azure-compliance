## Description

Disable anonymous access to blob containers and disallow blob public access on storage account.

Anonymous, public read access to a container and its blobs can be enabled in Azure Blob storage. It grants read-only access to these resources without sharing the account key, and without requiring a shared access signature. It is recommended not to provide anonymous access to blob containers until, and unless, it is strongly desired. A shared access signature token should be used for providing controlled and timed access to blob containers. If no
anonymous access is needed on the storage account, itâ€™s recommended to set allowBlobPublicAccess false.

## Remediation

### From Console

First, follow Microsoft documentation and create [shared access signature tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/delegating-access-with-a-shared-access-signature) for your blob containers. Then,

1. Login to Azure Storage Accounts
2. For each storage account, go to `Containers` under **DATA STORAGE**
3. Select the container, click **Access policy**
4. Set **Change access level** in top bar, to `Private (no anonymous access)`
5. For each storage account overview page, under `Blob Service` check the value set
6. Click on selected storage account `Configuration` under settings section of left bar
7. Set **Disabled** if no anonymous access is needed on the storage account
8. Click **Save**

### From Command Line

1. Identify the container name from the audit command

2. Set the permission for public access to private(off) for the above container name, using the below command

```bash
az storage container set-permission --name <containerName> --public-access off --account-name <accountName> --account-key <accountKey>
```

3. Set Disabled if no anonymous access is wanted on the storage account

```bash
az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access false
```

**Note:** By default, `Public access level` is set to `Private (no anonymous access)` for blob containers. By default, `AllowBlobPublicAccess` is set to `Null (allow in effect)` for storage account.
