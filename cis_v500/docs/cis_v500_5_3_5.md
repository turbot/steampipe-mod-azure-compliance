## Description

Ensure that any roles granting read, write, or owner permissions are removed from disabled Azure user accounts.

While an automated assessment procedure exists for this recommendation, the assessment status remains manual. Removing role assignments from disabled user accounts depends on the context and requirements of each organization and environment.
