## Description

Enabling purge protection on Azure Key Vaults ensures that deleted vaults and vault objects cannot be purged until the retention period has expired.

Key Vaults contain object keys, secrets, and certificates. Deletion of a Key Vault can cause immediate data loss or loss of security functions (authentication, validation, verification, non-repudiation, etc.) supported by the Key Vault objects.

It is recommended the Key Vault be made recoverable by enabling the "Do Not Purge" and "Soft Delete" functions. This is in order to prevent loss of encrypted data, including storage accounts, SQL databases, and/or dependent services provided by Key Vault objects (Keys, Secrets, Certificates) etc. This may happen in the case of accidental deletion by a user or from disruptive activity by a malicious user.

**NOTE:** Soft delete is enabled by default on all key vaults and cannot be disabled.

**WARNING:** A current limitation is that role assignments disappear when Key Vault is deleted. All role assignments will need to be recreated after recovery.

Setting `enablePurgeProtection` to "true" for a Key Vault ensures that even if Key Vault is deleted, Key Vault itself or its objects remain recoverable for the next 90 days. Key Vault/objects can either be recovered or purged (permanent deletion) during those 90 days. If no action is taken, the key vault and its objects will subsequently be purged.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Key Vaults`.
2. Click the name of a Key Vault.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Properties`.
4. Select the radio button next to `Enable purge protection (enforce a mandatory retention period for deleted vaults and vault objects)`.

**Note:** Once enabled, this option cannot be disabled.

5. Click `Save`.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for each Key Vault requiring remediation.

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az resource update --id /subscriptions/xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<keyVaultName> --set properties.enablePurgeProtection=true
```

### From PowerShell

```bash
Update-AzKeyVault -VaultName <vaultName> -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName> -EnablePurgeProtection
```

### Default Value

When a new Key Vault is created:
- `enableSoftDelete` is enabled by default (cannot be disabled)
- `enablePurgeProtection` is disabled by default
