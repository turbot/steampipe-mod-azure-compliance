## Overview

For most Azure tenants, and certainly for organizations with a significant use of Microsoft Entra ID, Conditional Access policies are recommended and preferred. To use Conditional Access Policies, a licensing plan is required, and **Security Defaults must be disabled**. Because of the licensing requirement, all Conditional Access policies are assigned a profile of "Level 2."

Conditional Access requires one of the following plans:

- Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2
- Microsoft 365 Business Premium
- Microsoft 365 E3 or E5
- Microsoft 365 F1, F3, F5 Security and F5 Security + Compliance
- Enterprise Mobility & Security E3 or E5.
