## Description

Ensure that OS disks (boot volumes) and data disks (non-boot volumes) are encrypted with CMK. By encrypting it ensures that the entire content is fully unrecoverable without a key and thus protects the volume from unwarranted reads. CMK is superior encryption although requires additional planning. You must have your key vault setup to encrypt.

## Remediation

### From Console

Disks must be detached from VMs to have encryption changed.

1. Go to `Virtual machines`.
2. For each virtual machine, go to `Settings`.
3. Click on `Disks`.
4. Click the `X` to detach the disk from the VM.
5. Now search for Disks and locate the unattached disk.
6. Click the disk then select `Encryption`
7. Change your encryption type, then select your encryption set
8. Click `Save`.
9. Go back to the VM and re-attach the disk.

### From PowerShell

```powershell
$KVRGname = 'MyKeyVaultResourceGroup';
$VMRGName = 'MyVirtualMachineResourceGroup';
$vmName = 'MySecureVM';
$KeyVaultName = 'MySecureVault';
$KeyVault = Get-AzKeyVault -VaultName $KeyVaultName -ResourceGroupName
$KVRGname;
$diskEncryptionKeyVaultUrl = $KeyVault.VaultUri; $KeyVaultResourceId = $KeyVault.ResourceId;
Set-AzVMDiskEncryptionExtension -ResourceGroupName $VMRGname -VMName $vmName -DiskEncryptionKeyVaultUrl $diskEncryptionKeyVaultUrl - DiskEncryptionKeyVaultId $KeyVaultResourceId;
```

**Note**
- During encryption it is likely that a reboot will be required, it may take up to 15 minutes to complete the process.
- This may differ for Linux Machines as you may need to set the -skipVmBackup parameter.
- By default, Azure disks are encrypted using SSE with PMK.
