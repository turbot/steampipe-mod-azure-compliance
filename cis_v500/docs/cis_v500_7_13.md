## Description

Enable HTTP/2 for improved performance, efficiency, and security. HTTP/2 protocol support is available to clients that connect to application gateway listeners only. Communication with backend server pools is always HTTP/1.1.

Enabling HTTP/2 supports use of modern encrypted connections.

1. Go to `Application gateways.`
2. Click the name of an application gateway.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Configuration`.
4. Under `HTTP2`, click `Enabled`.
5. Click `Save`.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for each application gateway requiring remediation.

**Remediate from Azure CLI**

For each application gateway requiring remediation, run the following command to enable HTTP2:

```bash
az network application-gateway update --resource-group <resource-group> --name <application-gateway> --http2 Enabled
```

**Remediate from PowerShell**

Run the following command to get the application gateway in a resource group with a given name:

```bash
$gateway = Get-AzApplicationGateway -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <application-gateway>
```

Run the following command to enable HTTP2:

```bash
$gateway.EnableHttp2 = $true
```

Run the following command to apply the update:

```bash
Set-AzApplicationGateway -ApplicationGateway $gateway
```

Repeat for each application gateway requiring remediation.

## Default Value
