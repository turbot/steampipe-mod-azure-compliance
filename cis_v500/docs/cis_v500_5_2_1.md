## Description

Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access allows an organization to configure Named locations and configure whether those locations are trusted or untrusted. These settings provide organizations the means to specify Geographical locations for use in conditional access policies, or define actual IP addresses and IP ranges and whether or not those IP addresses and/or ranges are trusted by the organization.

**Remediate from PowerShell**

Create a new trusted IP-based Named location policy

```bash
[System.Collections.Generic.List`1[Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.IpRange]]$ipR
anges = @()
$ipRanges.Add("<first IP range in CIDR notation>")
$ipRanges.Add("<second IP range in CIDR notation>")
$ipRanges.Add("<third IP range in CIDR notation>")
New-MgIdentityConditionalAccessNamedLocation -dataType
"#microsoft.graph.ipNamedLocation" -DisplayName "<name of IP Named location
policy>" -IsTrusted $true -IpRanges $ipRanges
```

Set an existing IP-based Named location policy to trusted

```bash
Update-MgIdentityConditionalAccessNamedLocation -PolicyId "<ID of the policy>" -dataType "#microsoft.graph.ipNamedLocation" -IsTrusted $true
```

## Default Value

By default, no locations are configured under the `Named locations` blade within the Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access blade.
