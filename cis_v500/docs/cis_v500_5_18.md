## Description

Restrict access to group web interface in the Access Panel portal.

## Rationale

The My Groups feature in the Access Panel (now part of My Apps/My Account portals) allows users to view and interact with their groups through a web interface. When enabled, users can:
- View groups they belong to
- See group membership details
- Access group-related settings and features
- View group resources and activities

While this functionality can be useful for collaboration, restricting it provides several security benefits:

**Reduced information disclosure:**
- Limits visibility into organizational structure
- Prevents users from seeing detailed group information
- Reduces reconnaissance opportunities for attackers
- Protects information about team compositions

**Controlled group management:**
- Enforces group management through official channels
- Prevents informal group-related activities
- Ensures group changes go through proper workflows
- Maintains better audit trail of group interactions

**Security considerations:**
- Reduces attack surface by disabling unnecessary features
- Limits potential social engineering vectors
- Prevents users from discovering internal organizational groups
- Reduces complexity of user-facing interfaces

**Governance and compliance:**
- Ensures group management follows organizational policies
- Better control over group-related activities
- Clearer audit trail through centralized management
- Easier to enforce data protection requirements

This is a CIS Level 2 recommendation, meaning it's for organizations with more stringent security requirements. Organizations should weigh the security benefits against potential impacts on user productivity and collaboration.

**Alternative approaches:**
- Users can still be members of groups
- Group functionality within specific apps (Teams, SharePoint) continues to work
- Administrators manage groups through admin center or PowerShell
- Self-service group management can still be enabled for specific scenarios

## Audit

**From Azure Portal:**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Groups`
3. Select `General` settings
4. Under `My Groups`, check the setting for `Restrict user ability to access groups features in My Groups`
5. Verify that it is set to `Yes`

**Note:** This setting controls access to the My Groups web interface in the Access Panel. It does not prevent users from being members of groups or accessing group resources through applications.

## Remediation

**From Azure Portal:**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Groups`
3. Select `General` settings
4. Under `My Groups`, find `Restrict user ability to access groups features in My Groups`
5. Set this to `Yes`
6. Click `Save`

**Effect of this setting:**

When enabled:
- Users cannot access the My Groups portal interface
- Users can still be members of groups
- Users can still access resources shared through groups
- Applications that use groups (Teams, SharePoint) continue to function normally
- Users can still see groups in specific applications
- Group management must be done by administrators

**What continues to work:**
- Group-based access to applications and resources
- Microsoft Teams (which uses Microsoft 365 Groups)
- SharePoint group functionality
- Group-based application assignments
- Distribution lists and security groups for mail/access
- Viewing groups within application contexts (e.g., Teams list)

**What is restricted:**
- Direct access to My Groups web portal
- Viewing comprehensive list of all groups in Access Panel
- Accessing group management features through My Groups
- Web-based group browsing capabilities

**Best Practices:**

1. **User communication:**
   - Inform users about the change
   - Explain that group functionality in apps still works
   - Provide guidance on accessing groups through Teams, SharePoint, etc.
   - Clarify how to request group membership changes

2. **Alternative access to group information:**
   - Users can see Teams they're members of in Microsoft Teams
   - SharePoint sites show relevant groups
   - Outlook shows distribution lists and mail-enabled groups
   - Applications show groups relevant to their context

3. **Self-service group management:**
   - If needed, configure specific self-service group scenarios
   - Use Azure AD access packages for controlled self-service
   - Enable group creation for specific groups of users if needed
   - Implement approval workflows for group requests

4. **Administrative group management:**
   - Establish clear processes for group requests
   - Designate group owners to manage membership
   - Regular review of group memberships
   - Document group purposes and owners

5. **Monitoring:**
   - Review group membership changes regularly
   - Monitor group creation and deletion
   - Track who is making group management changes
   - Alert on unexpected group modifications

6. **Consider organizational needs:**
   - Evaluate if restriction impacts user productivity
   - Some organizations may need the My Groups interface
   - Balance security with business requirements
   - This is a Level 2 recommendation, not mandatory for all

## Default Value

By default, `Restrict user ability to access groups features in My Groups` may be set to `No`, allowing users to access the My Groups web interface. Organizations with enhanced security requirements should change this to `Yes`.
