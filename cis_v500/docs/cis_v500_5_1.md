## Overview

This subsection contains recommendations for Security Defaults and Per-User Multi-Factor Authentication in Microsoft Entra ID.

Security defaults provide baseline security settings that are suitable for most organizations. They ensure that all users have basic security protections including MFA requirements for administrative accounts.

### Controls

- **5.1.1**: Security defaults enabled
- **5.1.2**: MFA enabled for all users
- **5.1.3**: Disable MFA device trust

### Security Defaults vs Conditional Access

Organizations can choose between:
- **Security Defaults**: Simple, automated security baseline suitable for smaller organizations
- **Conditional Access**: Advanced, granular policies suitable for larger organizations with specific requirements

Note: Security defaults and Conditional Access policies cannot be used simultaneously. Organizations using Conditional Access should disable security defaults and implement equivalent MFA policies through Conditional Access.
