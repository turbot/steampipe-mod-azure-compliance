## Description

Enable secure cluster connectivity (also known as no public IP) on Azure Databricks workspaces to ensure that clusters do not have public IP addresses and communicate with the control plane over a secure connection.

Enabling secure cluster connectivity limits exposure to the public internet, improving security and reducing the risk of external attacks.

## Remediation

**Remediate from Azure Portal**

1. Go to `Azure Databricks.`
2. Click the name of a workspace.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Networking`.
4. Under `Network access`, next to `Deploy Azure Databricks workspace with Secure Cluster Connectivity (No Public IP)`, click the radio button next to `Enabled`.
5. Click `Save`.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for each workspace requiring remediation.

**Remediate from Azure CLI**

For each workspace requiring remediation, run the following command to set `enableNoPublicIp` to `true`:

```bash
az databricks workspace update --resource-group <resource-group> --name <workspace> --enable-no-public-ip true
```

**Remediate from PowerShell**

For each workspace requiring remediation, run the following command to set `EnableNoPublicIP` to `True`:

```bash
