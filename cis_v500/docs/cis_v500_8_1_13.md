## Description

Microsoft Defender for Cloud emails the subscription owners whenever a high-severity alert is triggered for their subscription. Additional email addresses should be configured to ensure security alerts reach the appropriate security team members.

Configuring additional email addresses ensures that security incidents are communicated to the entire security operations team, not just subscription owners. This helps ensure timely response to security events.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Microsoft Defender for Cloud`.
2. Under `Management`, select `Environment settings`.
3. Click on a subscription name.
4. Click `Email notifications` in the left pane.
5. Under `Email recipients`, enter one or more email addresses in the `Additional email addresses` field (separated by commas).
6. Ensure `Notify about alerts with the following severity` is set appropriately (typically `High` or higher).
7. Click `Save`.

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az security contact create --name 'default' --email '<email-address-1>,<email-address-2>' --alert-notifications 'On' --alerts-admins 'On'
```

### From PowerShell

```bash
Set-AzSecurityContact -Name "default" -Email "<email-address-1>,<email-address-2>" -NotifyOnAlert On
```

### Default Value

Additional email addresses are not configured by default.
