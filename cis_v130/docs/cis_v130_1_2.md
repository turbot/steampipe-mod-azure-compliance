## Description

Enable multi-factor authentication for all non-privileged users.

Multi-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.

**Note:** By default, multi-factor authentication is disabled for all users.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Log in to [Azure Active Directory](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview)
2. Go to `Users`
3. Go to `All Users`
4. Click on **Multi-Factor Authentication** button on the top bar
5. Ensure that **MULTI-FACTOR AUTH STATUS** is `Enabled` for all users

To enable MFA

Follow Microsoft Azure [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa) and setup multi-factor authentication in your environment.
