## Overview

This section covers security recommendations to follow when setting various
security policies on an Azure Subscription. A security policy defines the set
of controls, which are recommended for resources within the specified Azure
subscription. Please note that the majority of the recommendations mentioned
in this section only produce an alert if a security violation is found. They
do not actually enforce security settings by themselves. Alerts should be
acted upon and remedied wherever possible.
