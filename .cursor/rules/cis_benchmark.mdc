# CIS Benchmark Structure in This Codebase

The CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark is implemented as a hierarchy of benchmarks and controls, organized by CIS section. Each top-level benchmark corresponds to a major CIS section (e.g., Storage, Networking, Identity), and contains sub-benchmarks and controls for each subsection and requirement.

See [cis_v400/section_10.pp](mdc:cis_v400/section_10.pp) for an example of how the CIS Storage Services section is structured, including its benchmarks and controls.

Benchmarks and controls use tags to encode CIS metadata such as section ID, item ID, level, and type, ensuring traceability to the CIS standard.
