## Description

Enable notifications for security alerts to ensure timely response to security incidents.

Configuring alert notifications based on severity ensures that the security team is informed about threats and security issues in a timely manner. Organizations should configure notifications for at least high-severity alerts to ensure critical security events receive immediate attention.
