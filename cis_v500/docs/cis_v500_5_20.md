## Description

Restrict security group management to administrators only.

## Rationale

This setting controls whether group owners can manage group membership requests through the My Groups portal. When enabled, group owners can:
- Approve or deny membership requests
- Add or remove members
- Manage group settings
- Delete groups they own

While delegating group management to owners can reduce administrative burden, it also creates security and governance risks:

**Security concerns:**
- Group owners may not have security training
- Potential for unauthorized access grants
- Owners might grant access without proper vetting
- No centralized oversight of membership changes
- Risk of compromised owner accounts granting malicious access

**Governance challenges:**
- Inconsistent access review processes
- Lack of audit trail for membership decisions
- Difficult to enforce security policies
- No standardized approval process
- Compliance and regulatory risks

**Access control risks:**
- Owners may grant excessive access
- Insider threats can abuse owner privileges
- No requirement for justification of access grants
- Potential for quid-pro-quo access grants
- Difficulty in tracking why access was granted

**Administrative oversight:**
- Security team loses visibility into access changes
- Can't enforce mandatory approval workflows
- Difficult to maintain least privilege
- Challenges in incident response and investigation
- Reduced ability to detect unauthorized access

By restricting group membership management to administrators:
- Centralized control over access decisions
- Consistent security review process
- Better audit trail and accountability
- Enforcement of access policies
- Reduced risk of unauthorized access
- Professional vetting of access requests

This is a CIS Level 2 recommendation, indicating it's for organizations with stringent security requirements. Organizations must balance security with operational efficiency.

## Audit

**From Azure Portal:**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Groups`
3. Select `General` settings
4. Under `Self Service Group Management`, check the setting for `Owners can manage group membership requests in My Groups`
5. Verify that it is set to `No`

## Remediation

**From Azure Portal:**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Groups`
3. Select `General` settings
4. Under `Self Service Group Management`, find `Owners can manage group membership requests in My Groups`
5. Set this to `No`
6. Click `Save`

**Effect of this setting:**

When disabled:
- Group owners cannot approve membership requests through My Groups portal
- Group owners cannot add/remove members through the portal
- Membership changes must be made by administrators
- Group owners maintain ownership but with reduced management capabilities
- Administrators use admin center, PowerShell, or Graph API for membership changes

**Who can still manage groups:**
- Global Administrator
- Groups Administrator
- User Administrator
- Other administrators with appropriate permissions

**What is affected:**
- My Groups portal functionality for owners
- Self-service group membership requests
- Owner-initiated membership changes through web interface

**What continues to work:**
- Administrators can still manage group membership
- PowerShell/CLI group management by admins
- Group-based access continues functioning
- Dynamic group membership (automatic)
- Groups in applications (Teams, SharePoint) for content, but not membership

**Best Practices:**

1. **Establish centralized group management:**
   - Create process for group membership requests
   - Define approval workflows with proper vetting
   - Require justification for access requests
   - Implement ticketing system for requests
   - Set SLAs for membership changes

2. **Compensating controls if enabled:**
   If your organization chooses to enable owner management:
   - Carefully vet group owners
   - Provide security training for owners
   - Regular audits of owner-granted access
   - Monitor group membership changes
   - Implement access reviews
   - Require owners to document decisions

3. **Alternative approaches:**
   - Use Azure AD access packages for self-service access
   - Implement automated approval workflows
   - Use dynamic groups where possible
   - Leverage application-specific membership management
   - Consider Entitlement Management for governance

4. **Communication:**
   - Inform group owners about the change
   - Provide clear instructions for requesting membership changes
   - Document the new process for access requests
   - Set expectations for response times
   - Offer admin support for legitimate needs

5. **Monitoring:**
   - Review group membership changes regularly
   - Monitor admin activities on groups
   - Alert on suspicious membership modifications
   - Track access request patterns
   - Regular compliance audits

6. **Documentation:**
   - Document which administrators handle group management
   - Maintain records of membership change requests
   - Track justifications for access grants
   - Keep audit trail of all changes
   - Document group purposes and ownership

7. **Consider organizational context:**
   - Evaluate impact on business operations
   - This is a Level 2 control (not mandatory for all)
   - Balance security with operational efficiency
   - May be too restrictive for some organizations
   - Consider risk tolerance and compliance requirements

**Delegation strategy if more flexibility needed:**

If complete restriction is too limiting:
- Use Azure AD access packages with approval workflows
- Implement just-in-time group membership
- Enable time-limited group membership
- Use Privileged Identity Management for group membership
- Create approval workflows through Power Automate or logic apps

## Default Value

The default setting may allow owners to manage group membership requests. Organizations with enhanced security requirements should disable this capability.
