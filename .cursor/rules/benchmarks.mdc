# Benchmarks Structure in This Codebase

Benchmarks are defined as HCL blocks using the `benchmark` keyword. Each benchmark represents a compliance standard or section and groups related controls or sub-benchmarks. Benchmarks typically include:

- `title` - Clear descriptive name
- `description` (optional) - Detailed explanation for non-CIS benchmarks
- `documentation` - Reference to detailed documentation file (commonly used in CIS benchmarks)
- `children` - List of controls or sub-benchmarks
- `tags` - Metadata for categorization and filtering

Different compliance standards structure their benchmarks differently:

1. CIS Benchmarks:
   - Organized by service or CIS section numbers
   - Use documentation blocks extensively
   - Example: [cis_v400/section_10.pp](mdc:cis_v400/section_10.pp) shows storage-related benchmarks

2. PCI DSS Benchmarks:
   - Organized by PCI DSS requirements
   - Include detailed requirement descriptions
   - Focus on specific security controls
   - Example: See requirement_3.pp for payment data security benchmarks

3. NIST Benchmarks:
   - Organized by NIST control families
   - Include control-specific descriptions
   - Focus on specific security objectives
   - Example: See mp.pp for media protection benchmarks

Benchmarks reference their children (controls or sub-benchmarks) by name, and use tags for metadata and filtering. Tags vary by compliance standard but help in organizing and querying the controls.
