## Description

Administrator accounts are sensitive. Any password reset activity notification, when sent to all administrators, ensures that all administrators can passively confirm if such a reset is a common pattern within their group. For example, if all administrators change their password every 30 days, any password reset activity before that may require administrator(s) to evaluate any unusual activity and confirm its origin.

## Remediation

Please note that at this point of time, there is no Azure CLI or other API commands
available to programmatically conduct security configuration for this recommendation.
