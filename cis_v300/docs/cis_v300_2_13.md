## Description

Allow users to provide consent for selected permissions when a request is coming from a verified publisher.

If Microsoft Entra ID is running as an identity provider for third-party applications, permissions and consent should be limited to administrators or pre-approved. Malicious applications may attempt to exfiltrate data or abuse privileged user accounts.
