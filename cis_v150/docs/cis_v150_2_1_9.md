## Description

Microsoft Defender for Cosmos DB scans all incoming network requests for changes to your virtual machine.

In scanning Cosmos DB requests within a subscription, requests are compared to a heuristic list of potential security threats. These threats could be a result of a security breach within your services, thus scanning for them could prevent a potential security threat from being introduced.
