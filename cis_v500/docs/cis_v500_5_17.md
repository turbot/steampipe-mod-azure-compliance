## Description

Restrict access to the Microsoft Entra ID administration center to administrators only.

## Rationale

The Microsoft Entra admin center (formerly Azure AD admin center) provides access to identity and access management settings for your organization. By default, all users (including non-administrators) can access the admin center interface, though their ability to make changes is limited by their assigned roles and permissions.

However, allowing non-administrators to access the admin center creates several security and operational concerns:

**Information disclosure:**
- Non-administrators can view the admin center interface
- Can see which administrative options exist (reconnaissance)
- May be able to view some organizational structure information
- Can learn about available administrative features and settings

**Social engineering risks:**
- Familiar interface makes social engineering attacks more credible
- Users may be tricked into thinking they can perform administrative actions
- Increases effectiveness of phishing attacks targeting admin credentials
- Confusion about who has administrative privileges

**Operational confusion:**
- Users may attempt to access settings they don't have permissions for
- Increases help desk calls from users trying to make changes
- Creates confusion about user vs. admin capabilities
- May lead to accidental disclosure of administrative workflows

**Security best practices:**
- Principle of need-to-know: users shouldn't access admin interfaces they don't need
- Reduces attack surface by limiting who can view admin settings
- Makes it clearer which users have administrative access
- Helps prevent unauthorized administrative attempts

Restricting access to the admin center ensures that only users with legitimate administrative responsibilities can access the interface, reducing information disclosure and potential social engineering vectors.

## Audit

**From Azure Portal:**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Users`
3. Select `User settings`
4. Under `Administration center`, check the setting for `Restrict access to Microsoft Entra administration center`
5. Verify that it is set to `Yes`

**Note:** This is a portal setting and cannot be verified via PowerShell or Graph API in a straightforward manner. The audit must be performed through the Azure Portal.

## Remediation

**From Azure Portal:**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Users`
3. Select `User settings`
4. Under `Administration center`, find `Restrict access to Microsoft Entra administration center`
5. Set this to `Yes`
6. Click `Save`

**Effect of this setting:**

When enabled:
- Only users with administrative roles can access the Microsoft Entra admin center
- Non-administrative users will receive an access denied message when attempting to access the admin center
- Users can still manage their own profile through MyAccount portal
- Users can still access other portals they have permissions for (Azure Portal for subscriptions, etc.)

**Administrative roles that retain access include:**
- Global Administrator
- Privileged Role Administrator
- User Administrator
- Password Administrator
- And other Entra ID administrative roles

**What users can still access:**
- MyAccount portal (myaccount.microsoft.com) - for managing their own profile
- MyApps portal (myapps.microsoft.com) - for accessing assigned applications
- Azure Portal (portal.azure.com) - if they have subscription/resource access
- Self-service password reset
- Self-service group management (if enabled)

**Best Practices:**

1. **User communication:**
   - Inform users about the change and why it's being made
   - Provide guidance on accessing portals they still need (MyAccount, MyApps)
   - Clarify how to request administrative changes
   - Document where to go for self-service features

2. **Self-service capabilities:**
   - Enable self-service password reset so users don't need admin center access
   - Configure self-service group management if appropriate
   - Use MyApps portal for application access management
   - Enable profile updates through MyAccount portal

3. **Administrative access:**
   - Document which roles can access the admin center
   - Use just-in-time administrative access (PIM) where possible
   - Regular review of who has administrative roles
   - Minimize standing administrative access

4. **Alternative access methods:**
   - For resource management: Use Azure Portal with appropriate RBAC
   - For profile updates: Use MyAccount portal
   - For password reset: Use self-service password reset
   - For application access: Use MyApps portal

5. **Monitoring:**
   - Monitor sign-in attempts to the admin center
   - Review who is accessing admin center regularly
   - Alert on unexpected access patterns
   - Audit administrative actions performed

6. **Exception handling:**
   - Some organizations may have legitimate reasons for limited non-admin access
   - Consider if specific users need read-only visibility
   - Document any exceptions and review regularly
   - Consider using Azure AD Premium P2 for more granular controls

## Default Value

By default, `Restrict access to Microsoft Entra administration center` may be set to `No`, allowing all users to access the admin center interface (though they cannot make changes without appropriate permissions). This should be changed to `Yes`.
