## Description

Enable notifications about attack paths to stay informed about potential security risks in your environment.

Attack path analysis in Microsoft Defender for Cloud identifies the routes that attackers could potentially use to breach your environment. By enabling notifications for attack paths, security teams can proactively address security gaps before they can be exploited.

Attack path notifications help you:
- Identify critical security risks
- Understand potential breach paths
- Prioritize remediation efforts
- Prevent lateral movement opportunities
