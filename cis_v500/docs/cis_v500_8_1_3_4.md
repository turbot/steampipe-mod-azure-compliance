## Description

Using disk snapshots, the agentless scanner scans for installed software, vulnerabilities, and plain text secrets without requiring any agent installation on the machines.

Agentless scanning provides:
- Software inventory
- Vulnerability assessment
- Malware detection
- Secret scanning (passwords, API keys, certificates)
- No performance impact on workloads

This component operates independently of agents and provides security insights without modifying or accessing the running VM.
