## Description

It is recommended that all keys in Azure Key Vault have an expiration time set. Azure Key Vault enables users to store and use cryptographic keys within the Microsoft Azure environment. The exp (expiration time) attribute identifies the expiration time on or after which the key *MUST NOT* be used for a cryptographic operation.

As default, keys never expire. It is thus recommended that keys be rotated in the key vault and set an explicit expiration time for all keys.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Login and go to `Key vaults`.
2. For each Key vault, go to `Settings` section and click on `Keys`.
3. Make sure `Status` is `Enabled`.
4. Set an appropriate `Expiration Date` on all keys.

### From Command Line

Command to update the `Expiration Date` for the key

```bash
az keyvault key set-attributes --name <keyName> --vault-name <vaultName> -- expires Y-m-d'T'H:M:S'Z'
```
