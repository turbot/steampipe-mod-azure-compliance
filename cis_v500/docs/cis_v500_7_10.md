## Description

Azure Web Application Firewall helps protect applications from common exploits and attacks by inspecting and filtering incoming traffic.

Using Azure Web Application Firewall with Azure Application Gateway reduces exposure to external threats by mitigating attacks on public facing applications.

## Remediation

**Note:** Basic tier application gateways cannot be upgraded to the WAF V2 tier. Create a new WAF V2 tier application gateway to replace a Basic tier application gateway.

**Remediate from Azure Portal**

To remediate a `Standard V2` tier application gateway:

1. Go to `Application gateways.`
2. Click `Add filter.`
3. From the `Filter` drop-down menu, select `SKU size.`
4. Check the box next to `Standard_v2` only.
5. Click `Apply`.
6. Click the name of an application gateway.
7. Under `Settings`, click `Web application firewall.`
8. Under Configure, next to Tier, click WAF V2.
9. Select an existing or create a new `WAF policy.`
10. Click `Save`.
11. Repeat steps 1-10 for each `Standard V2` tier application gateway requiring remediation.

## Default Value

Azure Web Application Firewall is enabled by default for the `WAF V2` tier of Azure Application Gateway. It is not available in the `Basic` tier. Application gateways deployed using the `Standard V2` tier can be upgraded to the `WAF V2` tier to enable Azure Web Application Firewall.
