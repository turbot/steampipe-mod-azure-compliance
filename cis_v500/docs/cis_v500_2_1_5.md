## Description

Unity Catalog is a centralized governance model for managing and securing data in Azure Databricks. It provides fine-grained access control to databases, tables, and views using Microsoft Entra ID identities. Unity Catalog also enhances data lineage, audit logging, and compliance monitoring, making it a critical component for security and governance.

    - Enforces centralized access control policies and reduces data security risks.
    - Enables identity-based authentication via Microsoft Entra ID.
    - Improves compliance with industry regulations (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) by providing audit logs and access visibility.
    - Prevents unauthorized data access through table-, row-, and column-level security (RLS & CLS).
