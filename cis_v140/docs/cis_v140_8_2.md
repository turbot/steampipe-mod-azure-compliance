## Description

Azure Key Vault enables users to store and use cryptographic keys within the Microsoft Azure environment. The exp (expiration time) attribute identifies the expiration time on or after which the key MUST NOT be used for a cryptographic operation. By default, keys never expire. It is thus recommended that keys be rotated in the key vault and set an explicit expiration time for all keys. This ensures that the keys cannot be used beyond their assigned lifetimes.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Go to `Key vaults`
2. For each Key vault, click on `Keys`.
3. Under the `Settings` section, Make sure `Enabled` is set to `Yes`
4. Set an appropriate `EXPIRATION DATE` on all keys.

### From Command Line

Command to update the `Expiration Date` for the key

```bash
az keyvault key set-attributes --name <keyName> --vault-name <vaultName> --expires Y-m-d'T'H:M:S'Z'
```

**Note**

- In order to access expiration time on all keys in Azure Key Vault using Microsoft API requires *List* Key permission
