## Description

Enable request body inspection so that the Web Application Firewall evaluates the contents of HTTP message bodies for potential threats.

Enabling request body inspection strengthens security by allowing the Web Application Firewall to detect common attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

## Remediation

**Remediate from Azure Portal**

1. Go to `Application gateways.`
2. Click the name of an application gateway.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Web application firewall.`
4. Under `Associated web application firewall policy`, click the policy name.
5. Under `Settings`, click `Policy settings.`
6. Check the box next to `Enforce request body inspection.`
7. Click `Save`.
8. Repeat steps 1-7 for each application gateway and firewall policy requiring remediation.

**Remediate from Azure CLI**

For each firewall policy requiring remediation, run the following command to enable request body inspection:

```bash
az network application-gateway waf-policy update --ids <firewall-policy> --policy-settings request-body-check=true
```

## Default Value

Request body inspection is enabled by default on Azure Application Gateways with Web Application Firewall.
