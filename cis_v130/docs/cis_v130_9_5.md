## Description

Managed service identity in App Service makes the app more secure by eliminating secrets from the app, such as credentials in the connection strings. When registering with *Azure Active Directory* in the app service, the app will connect to other Azure services securely without the need of username and passwords.

App Service provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service in Azure. It also provides a managed identity for apps, which is a turn-key solution for securing access to Azure SQL Database and other Azure services.

## Remediation
