## Description

Azure Databricks Diagnostic Logging provides insights into system operations, user activities, and security events within a Databricks workspace. Enabling diagnostic logs helps organizations:
    - Detect security threats by logging access, job executions, and cluster activities.
    - Ensure compliance with industry regulations such as SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR.
    - Monitor operational performance and troubleshoot issues proactively.

Diagnostic logging provides visibility into security and operational activities within Databricks workspaces while maintaining an audit trail for forensic investigations, and it supports compliance with regulatory standards that require logging and monitoring.

7. Click `Create alert rule.`

**Remediate from Azure CLI**

Enable diagnostic logging for Azure Databricks:

```bash
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name "DatabricksLogging" --resource <databricks-resource-id> --logs '[{"category": "accounts", "enabled": true}, {"category": "Clusters", "enabled": true}, {"category": "Notebooks", "enabled": true}, {"category": "Jobs", "enabled": true}]' --workspace <loganalytics-id>
```

Implement log retention policies:

```bash
az monitor log-analytics workspace update --resource-group <resource-group> --name <log-analytics-name> --retention-time 365
```

Monitor logs for anomalies:

```bash
az monitor activity-log alert create --name "DatabricksAnomalyAlert" --resource-group <resource-group> --scopes <databricks-resource-id> --condition "contains 'UnauthorizedAccess'"
```
