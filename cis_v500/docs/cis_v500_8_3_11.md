## Description

Restrict the validity period of certificates stored in Azure Key Vault to 12 months or less.

Limiting certificate validity reduces the risk of misuse if compromised and helps ensure timely renewal, improving security and reliability.

## Remediation

### Remediate from Azure Portal

For existing certificates:

1. Go to `Key vaults.`
2. Click the name of a key vault.
3. Under `Objects`, click `Certificates`.
4. Click the name of a certificate.
5. Click `Issuance Policy.`
6. Set `Validity Period (in months)` to an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
7. Click `Save`.
8. Repeat steps 1-7 for each key vault and certificate requiring remediation.

### Remediate from PowerShell

For each certificate requiring remediation, run the following command to set `ValidityInMonths` to an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive:

```bash
Set-AzKeyVaultCertificatePolicy -VaultName $vault.VaultName -Name <certificate-name> -ValidityInMonths <validity-in-months>
```

### Default Value

Validity Period (in months) is set to 12 by default.
