## Description

Microsoft Azure admin accounts should not be used for routine, non-administrative tasks.

## Rationale

Administrative accounts have elevated privileges that, if compromised, could lead to significant security breaches. Using these accounts for day-to-day activities increases the risk of:
- Credential exposure through phishing or malware
- Accidental misconfiguration or deletion of resources
- Difficulty in auditing and separating administrative actions from regular user activities
- Privilege escalation attacks

Organizations should follow the principle of least privilege by:
- Creating separate standard user accounts for daily tasks
- Using administrative accounts only for tasks that specifically require elevated privileges
- Implementing just-in-time access for administrative tasks when possible

## Audit

**Manual Audit Process:**

1. Review user sign-in activity for accounts with administrative roles
2. Identify accounts that show frequent sign-in activity (daily or multiple times per day)
3. Investigate the activities performed during these sign-ins
4. Determine if the activities were administrative in nature or routine tasks

**From Azure Portal:**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Users`
3. Select `Sign-in logs`
4. Filter by users with administrative roles
5. Review sign-in frequency and patterns
6. Investigate activities that occur with high frequency

**From PowerShell:**

```powershell
# Get users with administrative roles
Connect-AzureAD
$adminRoles = Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "*Administrator*"}
foreach ($role in $adminRoles) {
    $members = Get-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember -ObjectId $role.ObjectId
    foreach ($member in $members) {
        Write-Host "Admin Account: $($member.UserPrincipalName) - Role: $($role.DisplayName)"
    }
}

# Review sign-in logs (requires appropriate permissions and log analytics)
# This requires Azure AD Premium licensing
```

## Remediation

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Create separate accounts:**
   - Provide each administrator with two accounts:
     - A standard user account for daily tasks (email, document creation, web browsing)
     - An administrative account for privileged operations (prefixed with "admin-" or similar)

2. **Implement PAM/PIM:**
   - Use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to provide just-in-time access
   - Require approval and justification for administrative role activation
   - Set time limits for administrative access

3. **Configure Conditional Access:**
   - Create policies that restrict admin account usage to:
     - Specific managed devices
     - Trusted locations
     - Administrative applications only

4. **User education:**
   - Train administrators on when to use each account
   - Establish clear policies for administrative account usage
   - Implement regular reviews of administrative activities

**From Azure Portal:**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Users`
3. Click `+ New user`
4. Create standard user accounts for administrators who don't have them
5. Ensure administrative accounts are clearly named (e.g., admin-username@domain.com)

**Implement PIM (Requires Azure AD Premium P2):**

1. From Azure Home, select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Privileged Identity Management`
3. Select `Azure AD roles`
4. Select `Settings`
5. Configure role settings to require:
   - Activation time limits
   - Approval for activation
   - MFA for activation
   - Justification for activation

## Default Value

By default, there is no restriction on how administrative accounts are used. Organizations must implement policies and controls to manage this.
