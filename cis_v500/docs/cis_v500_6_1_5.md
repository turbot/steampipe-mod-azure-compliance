## Description

The use of Basic or Free SKUs in Azure whilst cost effective have significant limitations in terms of what can be monitored and what support can be realized from Microsoft. Typically, these SKUs do not have a service SLA and Microsoft may refuse to provide support for them. Consequently Basic/Free SKUs should never be used for production workloads.

While an automated assessment procedure exists for this recommendation, the assessment status remains manual. Determining appropriate SKUs depends on the context and requirements of each organization and environment.

## Remediation

Each resource has its own process for upgrading from basic to standard SKUs that should be followed if required.'
