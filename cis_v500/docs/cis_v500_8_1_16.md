## Description

Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Monitoring (EASM) continuously discovers and maps your digital attack surface to provide an external view of your online infrastructure.

Defender EASM provides:
- Continuous discovery of internet-facing assets
- Unknown and unmanaged asset identification
- Subdomain enumeration
- SSL/TLS certificate monitoring
- Open port and service detection
- Vulnerability assessment of external assets

By understanding your external attack surface, you can identify shadow IT, forgotten resources, and potential entry points that attackers might exploit.

## Remediation

5. Review and approve discovered assets.
6. Configure monitoring and alerting:
   - Set up alerts for new discoveries
   - Configure vulnerability notifications
7. Click `Create` or `Save`.

### Ongoing Management

- Regularly review newly discovered assets
- Classify assets as approved, requires investigation, or not owned
