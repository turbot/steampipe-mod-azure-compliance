## Description

Consider applying read-only locks to storage accounts to prevent modifications while still allowing read access.

Resource Manager read-only locks prevent any changes to resources, including updates and deletions. This can be useful for storage accounts that contain reference data or archived information that should not be modified. Unlike delete locks, read-only locks prevent both modifications and deletions.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Storage Accounts`.
2. For each storage account requiring read-only protection, under `Settings`, click `Locks`.
3. Click `+ Add`.
4. Provide a `Lock name`.
5. For `Lock type`, select `Read-only`.
6. Optionally, add notes explaining the purpose of the lock.
7. Click `OK`.

**Note:** Read-only locks prevent all write operations, including uploads and modifications. Ensure this is appropriate for your use case before applying.

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az lock create --name <lock-name> --lock-type ReadOnly --resource-group <resource-group> --resource-name <storage-account> --resource-type Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
```

### From PowerShell

```bash
New-AzResourceLock -LockName <lock-name> -LockLevel ReadOnly -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -ResourceName <storage-account> -ResourceType Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
```

### Default Value

No locks are applied by default.
