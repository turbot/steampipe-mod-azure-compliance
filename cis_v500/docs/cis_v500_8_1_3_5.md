## Description

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is a feature that monitors critical system files in Windows or Linux for potential signs of attack or compromise.

File Integrity Monitoring provides:
- Monitoring of critical OS files and registries
- Detection of unauthorized changes
- Alerts on file modifications, creations, and deletions
- Compliance validation for file integrity

FIM helps detect changes that might indicate a security breach, such as modifications to system binaries, configuration files, or registry entries.

## Remediation
