## Description

Ensure that all Global Administrators are notified if any other administrator resets their password.

## Rationale

Administrative accounts have elevated privileges that, if compromised, can lead to significant security breaches. Password reset events for administrative accounts are particularly sensitive security events that require immediate awareness and scrutiny.

Notifying all Global Administrators when any administrator resets their password provides several security benefits:

**Enhanced security monitoring:**
- Provides immediate visibility into administrative password changes
- Enables rapid detection of unauthorized password resets
- Creates awareness among the security team of potential compromise

**Collective security responsibility:**
- Leverages multiple administrators to watch for suspicious activity
- Increases the likelihood that unauthorized resets are quickly detected
- Distributes security monitoring across the admin team

**Incident response:**
- Enables quick response to potential account compromises
- Allows administrators to verify legitimacy of password resets with colleagues
- Provides early warning for coordinated attacks targeting admin accounts

**Audit and compliance:**
- Creates an audit trail with distributed notification
- Helps meet compliance requirements for privileged account monitoring
- Demonstrates due diligence in protecting administrative access

**Defense in depth:**
- Adds an additional layer of protection beyond technical controls
- Provides human verification of sensitive security events
- Complements MFA and other security measures

Without this notification, an attacker who successfully resets an administrator's password might gain privileged access without detection, potentially leading to extensive damage before discovery.

## Audit

**From Azure Portal:**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Password reset` under `Manage`
3. Select `Notifications`
4. Check the setting for `Notify all admins when other admins reset their password`
5. Verify that it is set to `Yes`

**Note:** Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) requires Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 licensing.

## Remediation

**From Azure Portal:**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Password reset` under `Manage`
3. Ensure that `Self service password reset enabled` is set to `All` or `Selected` (for target groups including admins)
4. Select `Notifications`
5. Set `Notify all admins when other admins reset their password` to `Yes`
6. Also ensure: `Notify users on password resets` is set to `Yes` (see recommendation 5.10)
7. Click `Save`

**What happens when enabled:**

When any administrator resets their password (through self-service or admin-initiated reset), all users with the Global Administrator role will receive an email notification containing:
- The name/UPN of the administrator whose password was reset
- Timestamp of the reset
- Information about what to do if the reset was unauthorized
- Contact information for security team

**Best Practices:**

1. **Global Administrator email configuration:**
   - Ensure all Global Administrators have valid, monitored email addresses
   - Use email addresses that Global Administrators check regularly
   - Consider using a security distribution list in addition to individual emails
   - Ensure email delivery is reliable and not blocked by spam filters

2. **Response procedures:**
   - Create and document procedures for responding to these notifications
   - Establish communication channels for administrators to verify resets
   - Define escalation procedures if reset was not authorized
   - Practice incident response for compromised admin accounts

3. **Verification process:**
   - Encourage administrators to verify password resets with colleagues
   - Establish a "buddy system" where admins can confirm each other's actions
   - Use secondary communication channels (phone, secure messaging) for verification
   - Document all verifications for audit purposes

4. **Incident response for unauthorized resets:**
   - Immediately disable the affected administrator account
   - Force sign-out of all sessions
   - Review recent activities of the compromised account
   - Reset the password again (by authorized admin)
   - Investigate how the unauthorized reset occurred
   - Review access to sensitive resources accessed by the compromised account

5. **Monitoring and logging:**
   - Monitor Azure AD audit logs for admin password reset events
   - Alert on multiple password reset attempts for admin accounts
   - Review sign-in logs after admin password resets
   - Track notification delivery and administrator response

6. **Additional security measures:**
   - Require MFA for all administrative accounts
   - Use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for just-in-time admin access
   - Implement Conditional Access policies for admin accounts
   - Enable Azure AD Identity Protection for risk-based policies
   - Consider using privileged access workstations (PAWs)

7. **Regular testing:**
   - Periodically test the notification system
   - Verify all Global Administrators receive notifications
   - Conduct tabletop exercises for unauthorized reset scenarios
   - Update contact information regularly

## Default Value

By default, when SSPR is enabled, administrator notification for admin password resets may be disabled. Organizations should explicitly enable this setting.
