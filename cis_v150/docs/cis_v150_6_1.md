## Description

Network security groups should be periodically evaluated for port misconfigurations. Where certain ports and protocols may be exposed to the Internet, they should be evaluated for necessity and restricted wherever they are not explicitly required.

The potential security problem with using RDP over the Internet is that attackers can use various brute force techniques to gain access to Azure Virtual Machines. Once the attackers gain access, they can use a virtual machine as a launch point for compromising other machines on an Azure Virtual Network or even attack networked devices outside of Azure.

## Remediation

Disable direct RDP access to your Azure Virtual Machines from the Internet. After direct RDP access from the Internet is disabled, you have other options you can use to access these virtual machines for remote management:

1. [Point-to-site VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal)
1. [Site-to-site VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal)
1. [ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/)

**Note:** By default, RDP access from internet is not enabled.
