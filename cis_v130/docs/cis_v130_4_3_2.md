## Description

It is recommended to enable *SSL connection* on MYSQL Servers. SSL connectivity helps to provide a new layer of security, by connecting database server to client applications using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Enforcing SSL connections between database server and client applications helps protect against attacks by encrypting the data stream between the server and application.
