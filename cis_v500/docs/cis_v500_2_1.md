## Overview

This section contains recommendations for Azure Databricks configurations.

Azure Databricks is an Apache Spark-based analytics platform optimized for Azure. Proper security configuration is essential to protect data and ensure secure access to Databricks workspaces and clusters.

### Key Security Areas

- **Network Security**: Deploy Databricks in custom VNets with proper network security groups and private endpoints
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Management**: Sync users from Microsoft Entra ID and control access with Unity Catalog
- **Token Management**: Restrict and enforce expiry for personal access tokens
- **Monitoring**: Enable diagnostic logging for audit and security analysis
- **Public Access**: Disable public IP and public network access to minimize exposure
