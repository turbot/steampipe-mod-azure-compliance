## Description

Ensure that virtual network flow logs are retained for greater than or equal to 90 days.

Virtual network flow logs provide critical visibility into traffic patterns. Logs can be used to check for anomalies and give insight into suspected breaches.

## Remediation

**Remediate from Azure Portal**

1. Go to `Network Watcher.`
2. Under `Logs`, select `Flow logs.`
3. Click `Add filter.`
4. From the `Filter` drop-down menu, select `Flow log type.`
5. From the `Value` drop-down menu, check `Virtual network` only.
6. Click `Apply`.
7. Click the name of a virtual network flow log.
8. Under `Storage Account`, set `Retention days` to `0`, `90,` or a number greater than 90. If `Retention days` is set to `0`, the logs are retained indefinitely with no retention policy.
9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 for each virtual network flow log requiring remediation.

**Remediate from Azure CLI**

Run the following command update the retention policy for a flow log in a network watcher, setting `retention` to `0`, `90`, or a number greater than 90:

```bash
az network watcher flow-log update --location <location> --name <flow-log> --retention <number-of-days>
```

Repeat for each virtual network flow log requiring remediation.

## Default Value

When a virtual network flow log is created using the Azure CLI, retention days is set to 0 by default. When creating via the Azure Portal, retention days must be specified by the creator.
