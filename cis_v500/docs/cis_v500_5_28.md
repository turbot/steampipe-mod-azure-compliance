## Description

Passwordless authentication methods improve security and user experience by replacing passwords with something you have (e.g., a hardware key), something you are (biometrics), or something you know, offering a convenient and secure way to
access resources.

Microsoft Entra ID and Azure Government integrate the following passwordless authentication options:
- Windows Hello for Business
- Platform Credential for macOS
- Platform single sign-on (PSSO) for macOS with smart card authentication
- Microsoft Authenticator
- Passkeys (FIDO2)
- Certificate-based authentication
