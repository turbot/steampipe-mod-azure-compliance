## Description

Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) policies should be enabled to provide security best practices and recommendations for Azure resources.

The Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark is a set of high-impact security recommendations you can use to help secure most services in Azure. These recommendations are generally applicable across Azure services and provide baseline security guidance. Disabling these policies removes important security recommendations from your security posture assessment.
