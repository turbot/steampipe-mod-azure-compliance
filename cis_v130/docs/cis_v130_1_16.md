## Description

Restrict group creation to administrators only.

Self-service group management enables users to create and manage security groups or Office 365 groups in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Unless a business requires this day-to-day delegation for some users, self-service group management should be disabled.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Log in to [Azure Active Directory](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview)
2. Go to `Groups`
3. Go to `General` in setting section
4. Ensure that `Restrict user ability to access groups features` in the Access Pane is set to **No**

**Note:** By default, Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access Pane is set to No.
