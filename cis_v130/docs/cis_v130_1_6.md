## Description

Ensure that the number of days before users are asked to re-confirm their authentication information is not set to 0.

If authentication re-confirmation is disabled, registered users will never be prompted to reconfirm their existing authentication information. If the authentication information for a user, such as a phone number or email changes, then the password reset information for that user reverts to the previously registered authentication information.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Log in to [Azure Active Directory](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview)
2. Go to `Users`
3. Go to `Password reset` in side bar
4. Go to `Registration`
5. Set the `Number of days before users are asked to re-confirm their authentication information` to your organization defined frequency

**Note:** By default, the 'Number of days before users are asked to re-confirm their authentication information' is set to '180 days'.
