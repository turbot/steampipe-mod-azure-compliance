## Description

Disable public network access to storage accounts to prevent unauthorized access from the internet.

When public network access is disabled, the storage account is not accessible from the public internet. Access is only allowed through private endpoints within virtual networks, providing an additional layer of security.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Storage Accounts`.
2. For each storage account, under `Security + networking`, click `Networking`.
3. Under `Public network access`, select `Disabled`.
4. Click `Save`.

**Note:** Ensure private endpoints are configured before disabling public network access to maintain connectivity.

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --public-network-access Disabled
```

### From PowerShell

```bash
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <storage-account> -PublicNetworkAccess Disabled
```

### Default Value

By default, public network access is enabled.
