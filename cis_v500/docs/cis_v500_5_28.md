## Description

Passwordless authentication methods improve security and user experience by replacing passwords with something you have (e.g., a hardware key), something you are (biometrics), or something you know, offering a convenient and secure way to access resources.

## Rationale

Traditional password-based authentication has well-known security weaknesses:
- Passwords can be guessed, stolen, or phished
- Users reuse passwords across sites
- Weak passwords are common
- Password fatigue leads to poor security practices
- Passwords can be intercepted or harvested
- Social engineering attacks target passwords

Passwordless authentication eliminates these risks by using alternative authentication factors:

**Types of passwordless authentication:**

1. **Windows Hello for Business**
   - Biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition)
   - PIN tied to specific device (using TPM)
   - Replaces passwords for Windows sign-in
   - Supports single sign-on to cloud resources

2. **FIDO2 Security Keys**
   - Physical hardware keys (USB, NFC, Bluetooth)
   - Public-key cryptography
   - Phishing-resistant
   - Works across multiple services

3. **Microsoft Authenticator App**
   - Phone sign-in without password
   - Push notification for approval
   - Biometric or PIN for verification
   - Works on iOS and Android

**Security benefits:**
- **Phishing-resistant**: Many methods can't be phished
- **No password to steal**: Eliminates password-based attacks
- **Strong authentication**: Based on cryptography and biometrics
- **Reduces attack surface**: No passwords to brute force or spray
- **Device-bound**: Credentials tied to specific devices
- **Multi-factor inherent**: Combines multiple authentication factors

**User experience benefits:**
- **Faster sign-in**: No typing passwords
- **More convenient**: Biometric or one-tap authentication
- **Less friction**: Reduces authentication fatigue
- **No password resets**: Eliminates forgotten password issues
- **Better mobile experience**: Optimized for modern devices

**Business benefits:**
- **Reduced help desk costs**: Fewer password reset tickets
- **Improved security posture**: Stronger authentication
- **Better compliance**: Meets modern security standards
- **Enhanced productivity**: Faster, easier authentication
- **Future-proof**: Aligned with industry direction

**When to consider passwordless:**
- Organizations ready to move beyond passwords
- High-security environments
- Organizations with significant phishing threats
- Modern device environments
- Organizations with mature identity management
- When improving user experience is a priority

This is a CIS Level 2 recommendation, meaning it's for organizations seeking enhanced security through modern authentication methods.

## Audit

**Manual Review:**

This is a manual control focused on whether the organization has considered and evaluated passwordless authentication methods. The audit should verify:

1. Organization has evaluated passwordless authentication options
2. Decision documented (to implement, timeline, or reasons not to)
3. If implementing, pilot or rollout plan exists
4. If implemented, adoption rates and success metrics

**From Azure Portal - Check enabled methods:**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Security`
3. Select `Authentication methods`
4. Review which passwordless methods are enabled:
   - Microsoft Authenticator
   - FIDO2 Security Key
   - Windows Hello for Business
5. Check configuration and user assignments for each method

**From Azure Portal - Check usage:**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Sign-in logs`
3. Filter by authentication method
4. Review usage of passwordless methods:
   - Authenticator App (Phone Sign-In)
   - FIDO2
   - Windows Hello for Business

**From PowerShell:**

```powershell
Connect-AzureAD

# Check authentication method policies
# Note: Requires Graph API access

# Check users registered for passwordless methods
$users = Get-AzureADUser -All $true
$passwordlessCount = 0

foreach ($user in $users) {
    # This is a simplified check - actual implementation requires Graph API calls
    # to get authentication methods per user
    Write-Host "Checking $($user.UserPrincipalName)"
}
```

## Remediation

This recommendation is about considering and planning for passwordless authentication. Implementation is a strategic decision. Here's a comprehensive approach:

**Step 1: Evaluate organizational readiness**

Consider:
- Device capabilities (TPM 2.0 for Windows Hello, NFC/USB for FIDO2)
- User population and technical proficiency
- Current authentication methods and policies
- Security requirements and compliance needs
- Budget for hardware keys if needed
- Help desk capacity and training

**Step 2: Choose appropriate passwordless methods**

**Microsoft Authenticator (Easiest to start):**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Security`
3. Select `Authentication methods`
4. Select `Microsoft Authenticator`
5. Enable the method
6. Configure settings:
   - Target users (start with pilot group)
   - Require number matching (recommended)
   - Show application name
   - Show geographic location
7. Click `Save`

**FIDO2 Security Keys:**

1. From Azure Home open the portal menu in the top left, and select `Microsoft Entra ID`
2. Select `Security`
3. Select `Authentication methods`
4. Select `FIDO2 Security Key`
5. Enable the method
6. Configure settings:
   - Target users (start with pilot group)
   - Allow self-service set up
   - Attestation enforcement level
   - Key restrictions (if specific keys required)
7. Click `Save`

**Windows Hello for Business:**

1. Configure via Intune/Configuration Manager or Group Policy
2. For cloud-based:
   - From Azure Home, search for `Intune` (Microsoft Endpoint Manager)
   - Navigate to `Devices` > `Enrollment` > `Windows enrollment`
   - Configure Windows Hello for Business settings
3. Set requirements:
   - Minimum PIN length
   - Require lowercase/uppercase/special characters
   - PIN expiration
   - Biometric authentication

**Step 3: Pilot deployment**
