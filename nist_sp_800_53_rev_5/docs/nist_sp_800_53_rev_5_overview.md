## Overview

[NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/release-search#!/800-53) represents a multi-year effort to develop the next generation of security and privacy controls needed to strengthen
and support the U.S. federal government. These next generation controls offer a proactive and systematic approach to ensure that
critical systems, components, and services are sufficiently trustworthy and have the necessary resilience to defend the economic and
national security interests of the United States.
