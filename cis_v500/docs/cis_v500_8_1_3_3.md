## Description

The Endpoint protection component enables Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (formerly Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection or ATP) to communicate with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides:
- Advanced threat protection
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- Automated investigation and remediation
- Threat and vulnerability management
- Attack surface reduction

Enabling this integration allows security teams to leverage Defender for Endpoint's capabilities within the Defender for Cloud console.
