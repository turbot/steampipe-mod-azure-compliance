## Description

Use Azure RBAC for managing access to Key Vault instead of access policies for fine-grained, role-based access control.

Azure Key Vault supports two authorization methods: access policies and Azure RBAC. Azure RBAC provides several advantages:
- Unified access management across Azure resources
- Centralized access control using Azure AD
- Support for Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
- Better audit and compliance capabilities
- More granular permissions

Using Azure RBAC is the recommended approach for new Key Vaults and provides better security and management capabilities.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Key Vaults`.
2. For each Key Vault, under `Settings`, click `Access configuration`.
3. Under `Permission model`, select `Azure role-based access control`.
4. Click `Apply`.

**Note:** Before migrating to RBAC, review existing access policies and create equivalent role assignments to avoid disrupting access.

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az keyvault update --name <vaultName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --enable-rbac-authorization true
```

### From PowerShell

```bash
Update-AzKeyVault -VaultName <vaultName> -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName> -EnableRbacAuthorization $true
```

### Default Value

Access policies are the default authorization method for Key Vaults. RBAC must be explicitly enabled.
