## Description

Network security groups should be periodically evaluated for port misconfigurations. Where RDP is not explicitly required and narrowly configured for resources attached to a network security group, Internet-level access to Azure resources should be restricted or eliminated.

## Remediation

**Remediate from Azure Portal**

1. Go to `Network security groups.`
2. Click the name of a network security group.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Inbound security rules.`
4. Check the box next to any inbound security rule matching:
    - Port: `3389` or range including 3389
    - Protocol: `TCP` or `Any`
    - Source: `0.0.0.0/0`, `Internet`, or `Any`
    - Action: `Allow`
5. Click `Delete`.
6. Click `Yes`.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each network security group requiring remediation.

**Remediate from Azure CLI**

For each network security group rule requiring remediation, run the following command to delete the rule:

```bash
az network nsg rule delete --resource-group <resource-group> --nsg-name <network-security-group> --name <rule>
```

## Default Value

By default, RDP access from internet is not enabled.
