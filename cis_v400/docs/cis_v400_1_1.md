## Overview

The suggested approach for securing your Microsoft Azure cloud environment is to start with the **latest version** of the CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark. Because CSP environments are constantly changing, previous versions of the Foundations Benchmarks should not be used. Previous releases may contain incorrect product names, outdated procedures, deprecated features, and other inaccuracies. The CIS Foundations Benchmark provides prescriptive guidance for configuring a subset of Microsoft Azure Services with an emphasis on foundational, testable, and architecture agnostic settings for services.

The Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark is what you should start with when beginning to secure your Azure environment. It is also the foundation for which all other Azure Service Category Benchmarks are built on so that as you grow your cloud presence and usage of the services offered you have the necessary guidance to securely configure your environment as it fits with your companyâ€™s policy.

All CIS Benchmarks are created and maintained through consensus-based collaboration. Should you have feedback, suggested changes, or just like to get involved in the continued maintenance and development of CIS Microsoft Azure Benchmarks, please register on CIS WorkBench at [https://workbench.cisecurity.org](https://workbench.cisecurity.org) and join the CIS Microsoft Azure Benchmarks Community.
