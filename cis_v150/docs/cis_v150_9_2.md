## Description

Azure Web Apps allows sites to run under both HTTP and HTTPS by default. Web apps can be accessed by anyone using non-secure HTTP links by default. Non-secure HTTP requests can be restricted and all HTTP requests redirected to the secure HTTPS port. It is recommended to enforce HTTPS-only traffic.

Enabling HTTPS-only traffic will redirect all non-secure HTTP request to HTTPS ports. HTTPS uses the SSL/TLS protocol to provide a secure connection, which is both encrypted and authenticated. So it is important to support HTTPS for the security benefits.

As default, HTTPS-only feature is disabled.

## Remediation

### From Console

  1. Login to Azure Portal and go to `App Services`.
  2. Click on each App.
  3. Under `Settings` section, click on `TLS/SSL settings`.
  4. Under `Protocol Settings`, set `HTTPS Only` to `On`.

### From Command Line

To set HTTPS-only traffic value for an existing app, run the following command:

```bash
az webapp update --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <APP_NAME> -- set httpsOnly=true
```
