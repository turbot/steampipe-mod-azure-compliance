## Description

The storage account container containing the activity log export should not be publicly accessible.

Allowing public access to activity log content may aid an adversary in identifying weaknesses in the affected account's use or configuration.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Search for Storage Accounts to access Storage account blade
2. Click on the `storage account name`
3. In Section `Blob Service` click **Containers** in side bar under `Data storage`. It will list all the containers in next blade
4. Look for a record with container named as `insight-operational-logs` used for the logging activities.
5. Click `Access Policy` from `Context Menu` and set `Public Access Level` to `Private` `(no anonymous access)`

### From Command Line

```bash
az storage container set-permission --name insights-operational-logs --account-name <Storage Account Name> --public-access off
```

**Note:** By default, public access is set to null (allowing only private access) for a container with activity log export.
