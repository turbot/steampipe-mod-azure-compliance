## Description

Storage accounts with the activity log exports can be configured to use Customer Managed Keys (CMK).

Configuring the storage account with the activity log export container to use CMKs provides additional confidentiality controls on log data, as a given user must have read permission on the corresponding storage account and must be granted decrypt permission by the CMK.

By default, for a storage account keySource is set to `Microsoft.Storage` allowing encryption with vendor Managed key and not the BYOK (Use Your Own Key).

## Remediation

5. Use option Enter `Key URI`or `Select from Key Vault` to set up encryption with your own key

### From Command Line
