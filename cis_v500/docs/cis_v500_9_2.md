## Azure Blob Storage

This section covers security best practice recommendations for Azure Blob Storage. Azure Blob Storage is a core storage service type for Azure Storage Accounts. Azure Data Lake services depend on the Azure Blob Service.

**NOTE:** If your organization is using Shared Access Signature (SAS) tokens, please review the CIS Microsoft Azure Storage Services Benchmark for best practice guidance on the configuration and use of those tokens.
