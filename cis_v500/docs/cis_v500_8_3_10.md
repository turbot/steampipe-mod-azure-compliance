## Description

Use Azure Key Vault Managed HSM for workloads that require FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs.

Azure Key Vault Managed HSM provides:
- FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs
- Single-tenant HSM instances
- Full administrative control over the HSM
- Support for customer-managed security domains
- Cryptographic operations performed in dedicated HSMs

Managed HSM should be used for workloads with high security requirements, such as:
- Financial services applications
- Payment processing systems
- Healthcare data encryption
- Government and compliance-sensitive workloads
- Certificate authorities

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Azure Key Vault Managed HSMs`.
2. Click `+ Create`.
3. Complete the creation wizard:
   - Select subscription and resource group
   - Provide a name for the Managed HSM
   - Select a region
   - Configure pricing tier
   - Configure access control (assign administrators)
4. Click `Review + create`, then `Create`.
5. After creation, initialize the HSM:
   - Download the security domain
   - Configure quorum for security domain recovery
6. Migrate keys and cryptographic operations to Managed HSM.

### Considerations

- **Cost:** Managed HSM is significantly more expensive than standard Key Vault
- **Use Cases:** Only use for workloads that explicitly require FIPS 140-2 Level 3
- **Migration:** Plan key migration carefully to avoid service disruption
- **Security Domain:** Secure the security domain backup properly

### Default Value

Managed HSM is not created by default and must be explicitly provisioned based on security requirements.
