## Description

Ensure that two alternate forms of identification are provided before allowing a password reset.

Like multi-factor authentication, setting up dual identification before allowing a password reset ensures that the user identity is confirmed via two separate forms of identification. With dual identification set, an attacker would require compromising both the identity forms before he/she could maliciously reset a user's password.
