## Description

This recommendation ensures that users accessing Microsoft Admin Portals (i.e. Microsoft 365 Admin, Microsoft 365 Defender, Exchange Admin Center, Azure Portal, etc.) are required to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) credentials when logging into an Admin Portal.

Administrative Portals for Microsoft Azure should be secured with a higher level of scrutiny to authenticating mechanisms. Enabling multi-factor authentication is recommended to reduce the potential for abuse of Administrative actions, and to prevent intruders or compromised admin credentials from changing administrative settings.

**IMPORTANT**: While this recommendation allows exceptions to specific Users or Groups, they should be very carefully tracked and reviewed for necessity on a regular interval through an Access Review process. It is important that this rule be built to include "All Users" to ensure that all users not specifically excepted will be required to use MFA to access Admin Portals.
