## Description

Set the minimum TLS version to 1.2 for storage accounts to ensure strong encryption and prevent the use of older, less secure protocols.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between client and server communications. TLS 1.2 is the current recommended version, providing stronger encryption algorithms and improved security over TLS 1.0 and 1.1. Older TLS versions have known vulnerabilities and should not be used.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Storage Accounts`.
2. For each storage account, under `Settings`, click `Configuration`.
3. Under `Minimum TLS version`, select `Version 1.2`.
4. Click `Save`.

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --min-tls-version TLS1_2
```

### From PowerShell

```bash
Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <storage-account> -MinimumTlsVersion TLS1_2
```

### Default Value

The default minimum TLS version for new storage accounts is TLS 1.2, but this should be verified for existing accounts.
