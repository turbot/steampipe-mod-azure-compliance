## Description

Enabling blob versioning allows for the automatic retention of previous versions of objects. With blob versioning enabled, earlier versions of a blob are accessible for data recovery in the event of modifications or deletions.

Blob versioning safeguards data integrity and enables recovery by retaining previous versions of stored objects, facilitating quick restoration from accidental deletion, modification, or malicious activity.
