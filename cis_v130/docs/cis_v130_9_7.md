## Description

Periodically, newer versions are released for *Python software* either due to security flaws or to include additional functionality. Using the latest Python version for web apps is recommended in order to take advantage of security fixes, if any, and/or additional functionalities of the newer version.

Newer versions may contain security enhancements and additional functionality. With each software installation, organizations need to determine if a given update meets their requirements and also verify the compatibility and support provided for any additional software against the update revision that is selected.
