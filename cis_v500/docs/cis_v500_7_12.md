## Description

The TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol secures the transmission of data over the internet using standard encryption technology. Application gateways use TLS 1.2 for the Min protocol version by default and allow for the use of TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.3. NIST strongly suggests the use of TLS 1.2 and recommends the adoption of TLS 1.3.

TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are outdated and vulnerable to security risks. Since TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 provide enhanced security and improved performance, it is highly recommended to use TLS 1.2 or higher whenever possible.

## Remediation

**Remediate from Azure Portal**

1. Go to` Application gateways.`
2. Click the name of an application gateway.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Listeners`.
4. Under `SSL Policy`, next to the `Selected SSL Policy` name, click `change`.
5. Select an appropriate SSL policy with a `Min protocol version` of `TLSv1_2` or higher.
6. Click `Save`.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each application gateway requiring remediation.

**Remediate from Azure CLI**

Run the following command to list available SSL policy options:

```bash
az network application-gateway ssl-policy list-options
```

Run the following command to list available predefined SSL policies:

```bash
az network application-gateway ssl-policy predefined list
```

For each application gateway requiring remediation, run the following command to set a predefined SSL policy:

```bash
az network application-gateway ssl-policy set --resource-group <resourcegroup> --gateway-name <application-gateway> --name <ssl-policy> --policy-type Predefined
```

Alternatively, run the following command to set a custom SSL policy:

```bash
az network application-gateway ssl-policy set --resource-group <resourcegroup> --gateway-name <application-gateway> --policy-type Custom --minprotocol-version <min-protocol-version> --cipher-suites <cipher-suites>
```

## Default Value

`Min protocol version` is set to `TLSv1_2` by default.
