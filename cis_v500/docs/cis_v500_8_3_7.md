## Description

Disabling public network access to Azure Key Vault ensures that the vault is not accessible from the public internet.

Public network access exposes Key Vaults to potential attacks from the internet. By disabling public access and using private endpoints, you ensure that Key Vault can only be accessed from within your virtual network, providing an additional layer of security.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `Key Vaults`.
2. For each Key Vault, under `Settings`, click `Networking`.
3. Under `Firewalls and virtual networks`, select `Disable public access`.
4. Ensure that private endpoints are configured to maintain connectivity.
5. Click `Apply`.

**Note:** Ensure private endpoints are configured before disabling public access to avoid losing connectivity.

### From Azure CLI

```bash
az keyvault update --name <vaultName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --public-network-access Disabled
```

### From PowerShell

```bash
Update-AzKeyVault -VaultName <vaultName> -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName> -PublicNetworkAccess Disabled
```

### Default Value

By default, public network access is enabled for Key Vaults.
