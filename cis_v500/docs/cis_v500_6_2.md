## Description

Resource Manager Locks provide a way for administrators to lock down Azure resources to prevent deletion of, or modifications to, a resource. These locks sit outside of the Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) hierarchy and, when applied, will place restrictions on the resource for all users. These locks are very useful when there is an important resource in a subscription that users should not be able to delete or change. Locks can help prevent accidental and malicious changes or deletion.

While an automated assessment procedure exists for this recommendation, the assessment status remains manual. Determining resources that require resource locks depends on the context and requirements of each organization and environment.

## Remediation

**Remediate from Azure Portal**

1. Navigate to the specific Azure Resource or Resource Group.
2. For each mission critical resource, click on `Locks`.
3. Click `Add`.
4. Give the lock a name and a description, then select the type, `Read-only` or `Delete` as appropriate.
5. Click `OK`.

**Remediate from Azure CLI**

To lock a resource, provide the name of the resource, its resource type, and its resource group name.

```bash
az lock create --name <LockName> --lock-type <CanNotDelete/Read-only> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --resource-name <resourceName> --resourcetype <resourceType>
```

**Remediate from PowerShell**

```bash
Get-AzResourceLock -ResourceName <Resource Name> -ResourceType <ResourceType> -ResourceGroupName <Resource Group Name> -Locktype <CanNotDelete/Readonly>
```

## Default Value

By default, no locks are set.
