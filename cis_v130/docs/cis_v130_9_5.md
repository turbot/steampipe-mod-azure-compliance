## Description

Managed service identity in App Service makes the app more secure by eliminating secrets from the app, such as credentials in the connection strings. When registering with *Azure Active Directory* in the app service, the app will connect to other Azure services securely without the need of username and passwords.

App Service provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service in Azure. It also provides a managed identity for apps, which is a turn-key solution for securing access to Azure SQL Database and other Azure services.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Login to Azure Portal and go to `App Services`.
2. Click on each App.
3. Under `Settings` section, click on `Identity`.
4. From `System assigned` tab, set `Status` to `On`.
5. Click `Save`.

### From Command Line

```bash
az webapp identity assign --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <APP_NAME>
```
