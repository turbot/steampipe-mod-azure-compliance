## Description

Network security groups should be periodically evaluated for port misconfigurations. Where UDP is not explicitly required and narrowly configured for resources attached to a network security group, Internet-level access to Azure resources should be restricted or eliminated.

The potential security problem with broadly exposing UDP services over the Internet is that attackers can use DDoS amplification techniques to reflect spoofed UDP traffic from Azure Virtual Machines. The most common types of these attacks exploit exposed DNS, NTP, SSDP, SNMP, CLDAP, and other UDP-based services as amplification sources to disrupt services on other machines within the Azure Virtual Network, or even attack networked devices outside of Azure.

## Remediation

**Remediate from Azure Portal**

1. Go to Network security groups.
2. Click the name of a network security group.
3. Under `Settings`, click `Inbound security rules.`
4. Check the box next to any inbound security rule matching:
   - Port: Port: `53`, `123`, `161`, `389`, or `1900`, or range including `53`, `123`, `161`, `389`, or `1900`, or other vulnerable UDP-based services
   - Protocol: `UDP` or `Any`
   - Source: `0.0.0.0/0`, `Internet`, or `Any`
   - Action: `Allow`
5. Click `Delete`.
6. Click `Yes`.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each network security group requiring remediation.

**Remediate from Azure CLI**

For each network security group rule requiring remediation, run the following command to delete the rule:

```bash
az network nsg rule delete --resource-group <resource-group> --nsg-name <network-security-group> --name <rule>
```

## Default Value

By default, UDP access from internet is not `enabled`.
